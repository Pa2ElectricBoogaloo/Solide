	abstract = {This review elaborates pedagogically on the fundamental concept, basic theory, expected properties, and materials realizations of topological superconductors. The relation between topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions are explained, and the difference between dispersive Majorana fermions and a localized Majorana zero mode is emphasized. A variety of routes to topological superconductivity are explained with an emphasis on the roles of spin-orbit coupling. Present experimental situations and possible signatures of topological superconductivity are summarized with an emphasis on intrinsic topological superconductors.},

	abstract = {Ever since its discovery, the Berry phase has permeated through all branches of physics. Over the last three decades, it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as ferroelectricity, orbital magnetism, various (quantum/anomalous/spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. We start with a brief summary of necessary background, followed by a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate a re-quantization method that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as a basic ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator, but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. The 2D topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A 3D topological insulator supports novel spin polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium article we will review the theoretical foundation for these electronic states and describe recent experiments in which their signatures have been observed. We will describe transport experiments on HgCdTe quantum wells that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. We will then discuss experiments on Bi\_\{1-x\}Sb\_x, Bi\_2 Se\_3, Bi\_2 Te\_3 and Sb\_2 Te\_3 that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. We will then describe exotic states that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions, and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. We will close by discussing prospects for observing these exotic states, a well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

	abstract = {Quantum charge pumping phenomenon connects band topology through the dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system. In terms of a microscopic model, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger/Rice-Mele quantum pump continues to serve as a fruitful starting point for many considerations of topological physics. Here we present a generalized Creutz scheme as a distinct two-band quantum pump model. By noting that it undergoes two kinds of topological band transitions accompanying with a Zak-phase-difference of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ and \$2{\textbackslash}pi\$, respectively, various charge pumping schemes are studied by applying an elaborate Peierl's phase substitution. Translating into real space, the transportation of quantized charges is a result of cooperative quantum interference effect. In particular, an all-flux quantum pump emerges which operates with time-varying fluxes only and transports two charge units. This puts cold atoms with artificial gauge fields as an unique system where this kind of phenomena can be realized.},

	abstract = {Control and manipulation of electromagnetic waves has reached a new level with the recent understanding of topological states of matter. These metamaterials have the potential to revolutionize many areas in traditional electromagnetic design, from highly robust cavities to small footprint waveguides. Much of the past literature has been on the cutting edge of condensed matter physics, but there is now ample opportunity to explore their usage for practical microwave and optical devices. To assist the beginner, in this Tutorial we give a basic introduction to the essential concepts of topological phenomena in electromagnetic systems, including geometric phases, topological invariants, pseudospin states, and the integer/valley/spin quantum Hall effects. Our focus is on engineered photonic topological insulators (PTIs) in two-dimensional systems. We highlight methods for characterizing such structures and how they result in unique wave-guiding properties. In addition, we provide recipes on how to realize PTIs using photonic crystals and metasurfaces, examine differences between different types of PTIs, and discuss limitations and advantages of some of the existing enabling platforms.},

This review presents a pedagogical account on topological insulator materials with an emphasis on basic theory and materials properties. After presenting a historical perspective and basic theories of topological insulators, it discusses all the topological insulator materials discovered as of May 2013, with some illustrative descriptions of the developments in materials discoveries in which the author was involved. A summary is given for possible ways to conﬁrm the topological nature in a candidate material. Various synthesis techniques as well as the defect chemistry that are important for realizing bulk-insulating samples are discussed. Characteristic properties of topological insulators are discussed with an emphasis on transport properties. In particular, the Dirac fermion physics and the resulting peculiar quantum oscillation patterns are discussed in detail. It is emphasized that proper analyses of quantum oscillations make it possible to unambiguously identify surface Dirac fermions through transport measurements. The prospects of topological insulator materials for elucidating novel quantum phenomena that await discovery conclude the review.},
