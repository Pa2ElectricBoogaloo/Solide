This sections aims to describe the notion of topological invariant and its consequence on the band structure. 
\subsection{Topological equivalence of insulators}
In a periodic lattice potential, electrons are described by bloch states $\ket{n, \mathbf{k}}$ where $n$ is a dicrete quantum number and $\mathbf{k}$ is the crystal momentum in the brillouin zone \cite{shankar_topological_2018}. Each of those states is associated to an energy $E_{n, \mathbf{k}}$.  As it varies with $\mathbf{k}$, the energy sweeps a continous range called a band labeled with the number $n$. Bands are often separated by energy gaps where there are no states. Trivial insulators have a gapped ground state meaning that low energy excitations are forbidden by the presence of the gap. On the contrary, topological insulators have metallic (gapless edge states)\cite{kane_topological_2013} and are different from trivial insulators in a fundamental way.\\ 

Slow modifications of the hamiltonian of a trivial insulator will change its band structure while leaving it in its ground state. The \textit{deformation} is said to yield equivalent insulators if the gap doesn't close \cite{kane_topological_2013}. This equvalence is topological in the same way the continuous disformation from a torus to a coffee mug is. Just like the coffee mug cannot be continuously disformed into a sphere, a trivial insulator cannot be continuously disformed into a topological insulator.\\

For the coffee mug and the sphere, a number tells if there is topological equivalence or not. This number is called the genus (the number of holes) and it as analogues for topological insulators \cite{batra_physics_2020}. The central property of genus is that it only changes when the torus is broken into a sphere in a necessarly discontinuous way. Therefore, the genus is a topological invariant for the sphere and torus. For the QH effect the topological invariant indicating the persistance of the edge states uppon deforming the Hamiltonian is the Chern number. For the QSH effect, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is involved \cite{kane_topological_2013}. In the following section, the link between time reversal symmetry and this last invariant is detailed.  Mixing symmetry, topological invariants and dimensionnality allows for a classification of topological insulators in a form similar to the \textit{periodic table} of elements \cite{hasan_topological_2010}. 

\subsection{Time reversal symmetry}
In a quantum mechanical setting, an operator $U$ (unitary or anti-unitary) corresponds to a symmetry of a system when $U H U^{-1} = H$ where $H$ is the hamiltonian governing the motion of the system. For a time reversal symetric (TRS) system this means that evolution follows the same equations of motion as a movie of itself set on rewind \cite{shankar_topological_2018}. The operator sending a system to its time reverse is an anti-unitary operator noted $\Theta$ and TRS corresponds to $\Theta H \Theta^{-1} = H$. In the position representation of the spin, momentum and position observables of an electron, the intuitive effects of this time reversal operator are the following \cite{shankar_topological_2018} : 
\begin{align*}
    \Theta \mathbf{s} \Theta^{-1} &=-\mathbf{s}, \\
    \Theta \mathbf{r} \Theta^{-1} &=\mathbf{r}, \\
    \Theta (-i\hbar\nabla) \Theta^{-1} &=+i\hbar\nabla
\end{align*}
meaning it sets electrons spinning backwards with a reversed velocity. The operator satisfying all those porperties is the $\Theta = i s_y K$ where $K$ represents complex conjugation and the $i s_y$ factor ensures spin is fully reversed \cite{bernevig_topological_2013}. The essential property of the time reversal operator for electrons is that is satsifies $\Theta^2 = -1$. Hence reversing time twice doesn't lead to the original states\cite{hasan_topological_2010}! This leads to Kramer's theorem which states the following:
\begin{align*}
    K
\end{align*} \\

Time reversal symmetry (TRS) plays an important role in QSH topological insulators: it protects the gapless edge states \cite{kane_topological_2013}. While the QH effect requiers a magnetic field to occur (breaking of TRS), the QSH effect doesn't and it preserves TRS\cite{cayssol_topological_2021}.
