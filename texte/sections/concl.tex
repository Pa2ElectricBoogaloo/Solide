The study of topological insulators is a beautiful application of topology to solid-state physics. It gives profound insight on key properties of some material and some effects using what could've been considered abstract math. Some powerful concept such as the berry phase and Kramerâ€™s theorem rapidly come into play. These concepts allow understanding otherwise very hard to understand yet important phenomena such has Hall effect. The mix of topological and solid-state physics physics howerver doesn't end there. There are other kinds of topological material such as topological \textit{superconductors}. Topological superconductivity, however, has been observed in far fewer materials. Such material still has important applications such as \textit{protected quantum computation}. \cite{nayak_evidence_2021} A lot of research of these materials will likely be done in the upcomming years.
