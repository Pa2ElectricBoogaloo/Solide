One of the defining properties of topological insulators is the presence of conducting edge states with an insulating bulk. The example considered here in sec. \ref{sec:ti_exemples} is a two dimensionnal material and its edge is therefore one-dimensionnal. The QH and QSH effects both involve one-dimensionnal conduction. In one dimension, electrons can only either move forward of backward on the edge of the sample and this restriction is central for Hall effects. \cite{qi_quantum_2010}.  
\subsection{QH}

The QH effect consists of a quantized \textit{Hall conductivity} $\sigma_{xy}(=\frac{I_x}{V_y})$. The link with topology is fairly direct since the Hall Conductivity is directly proportional to the Chern number! In fact we have.
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{xy} = n\frac{e^2}{\hbar}
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the Chern number

\subsubsection{Chern number}

% The Chern number is a topological invariant closely related to the Euler characteristic. In fact you can write the \textit{topological solid} equivalent of the \textit{Gauss-bonnet} theorem
