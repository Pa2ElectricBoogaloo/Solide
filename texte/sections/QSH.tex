One of the defining properties of topological insulators is the presence of conducting edge states with an insulating bulk. The example considered here in sec. \ref{sec:ti_exemples} is a two-dimensional material and its edge is therefore one-dimensional. The QH and QSH effects both involve one-dimensional conduction. In one dimension, electrons can only either move forward or backward on the edge of the sample and this restriction is central for Hall effects. \cite{qi_quantum_2010}. 
\subsection{QH}
The QH effect occurs in two-dimensional semiconductor electron gas with a strong applied magnetic field \cite{qi_quantum_2010}. In such a system, electrons occupy \textit{Landau levels} which roughly correspond to a cyclotron motion with a certain \textit{radius}.\cite{laughlin_quantized_1981}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sections/visuel/Hall_effect.png}
    \caption{Hall Effect measurements. The upper curve represents the Hall resistance ($R_h \propto \frac{1}{\sigma_{xy}}$) and shows its plateaus while the lower one represent $R_{xx} \propto \rho_{xx}$ and shows its vanishing. Both curves are a function of the magnetic field. \cite{jeckelmann_quantum_nodate}}
    \label{fig:Hall_effet}
\end{figure}

This effect consists of a two simultaneous and related phenomena. The quantized \textit{Hall conductivity} $\sigma_{xy}(=\frac{I_x}{V_y})$ and the vanishing of the $\rho_{xx}$ resistivity in a 2D electron gas. The vanishing of $\rho_{xx}$ is due to the existence of edges states.%because the conducting edge states only carry current in one direction on a given side of the sample.
Such edge state exists because of the discontinuity between the Chern number of the material and the Chern number of empty space. The symmetry breaking region that is the edge of the material implies an unusual asymmetric dispersion relation, which has forward-moving states then backward moving state, imposing conduction along the edges. One can show that the difference between the number of forward  propagating state and the number of backward propagating states at the Fermi level must always be the difference between the Chern numbers of the two material\cite{kane_topological_2013}. That is: $$N_f -N_b = \mathcal{C}$$ These states are resilient to impurities since adding them can't lead to backscattering of the electrons because there are simply no available backward moving states they can scatter into \cite{qi_quantum_2010}. This means that these states have perfect conductivity. Not so surprisingly, the $\sigma_{xy}$ plateaus can also be directly linked to the Chern number. The link is fairly direct since the Hall Conductivity is directly proportional to the Chern number! In fact, we have.
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{xy} = \mathcal{C}\frac{e^2}{\hbar}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{C} \in \mathbb{N}$ is the Chern number. This connection between the Chern number and Hall conductivity is made more apparent by considering a third quantity: The number of accessible Landau levels to the system $\nu$ . Since the Chern number is proportional to the number of filled bands (they are summed over to find $\mathcal{C}$) and Landau levels act like bands in this context \cite{kane_topological_2013}, it can be inferred that $\mathcal{C}\propto \nu$. Also, if $\Delta V$ is the potential difference generated by the Hall effect (for a constant current) and $\Delta n_e$ is the number of electrons moved from one side of the material to the other in order to create the potential difference then $\rho_{xy} \propto \Delta V \propto \Delta n_e$. It is then possible to show that the number of electron that you can transfer from one side to the other is direcly proportional to the number of Landau level accessible meaning $\sigma_{xy} \propto \cal{C}$.

\subsection{QSH}

The QSH state can be obtained from the combination of two copies of the QH state \cite{buhmann_quantum_2011}. In this new state, two counter-propagating channels of edge states exist on each side of the sample. Kramer's theorem (see sec. \ref{TRS}) relates these pairs of edge states with TRS \cite{buhmann_quantum_2011}. Since these states are related by TRS, they have opposite crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$ and spin: they are \textit{helical} edge states \cite{bernevig_topological_2013}. Since helical states couple $\mathbf{k}$ with spin, QSH states can only be realized in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling \cite{qi_quantum_2010}. The number of Kramer pairs of edge states is an example of an $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant which tells if the state is topological or not \cite{koenig_quantum_2008}. Here, the helical states come in one Kramer pair (taking effect on both sides of the sample), so there is an odd number of Kramer pairs and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant allows calling the QSH state a topological state of matter.\\

The impossibility of backscattering on impurities in the QSH state can be directly related to the effect of an antireflection lens \cite{qi_quantum_2010}. The effect of scattering on an impurity is represented in fig. \ref{lens} (B). Two quantum paths can be taken by the electron encountering the impurity. In both cases a helical state must be converted into its Kramer partner by the scattering in order to reverse the direction of motion. When the electron goes around the impurity, its spin turns by an angle of $\pm \pi$ depending on the sense of rotation around the impurity (fig. \ref{lens} (B) up and down shows the two possible paths swapping momentum direction). The global angle difference between the two spin rotations is $2\pi$. Because the phase of half-integer particles rotates with half the speed of the actual rotation witnessed by the electron, the $2\pi$ angle difference becomes a $\pi$ phase shift. A completely destructive interference between the two quantum paths emerges \cite{barut_path_1992} and the backscattering is forbidden. This is just like perfect transmission of an antireflection lens generated by the destructive interference of the red and blue paths of fig. \ref{lens} (A).
