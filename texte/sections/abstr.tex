The field of topological insulators is a recent and very broad. This review aims to be an introduction to the topic. It covers the basic topological concept required to understand the theory such as the idea of topological equivalence, Kramer's theorem and the berry phase. Some of the earliest and simplest application of the theory  are quickly explained. These cover the Integer Quantum and Quantum Spin Hall effect, and the example of the HGTE/CDTE heterostructure.
