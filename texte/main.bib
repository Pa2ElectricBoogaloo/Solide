abstract = {Ever since its discovery, the Berry phase has permeated through all branches of physics. Over the last three decades, it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as ferroelectricity, orbital magnetism, various (quantum/anomalous/spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. We start with a brief summary of necessary background, followed by a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate a re-quantization method that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as a basic ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties.},

abstract = {Control and manipulation of electromagnetic waves has reached a new level with the recent understanding of topological states of matter. These metamaterials have the potential to revolutionize many areas in traditional electromagnetic design, from highly robust cavities to small footprint waveguides. Much of the past literature has been on the cutting edge of condensed matter physics, but there is now ample opportunity to explore their usage for practical microwave and optical devices. To assist the beginner, in this Tutorial we give a basic introduction to the essential concepts of topological phenomena in electromagnetic systems, including geometric phases, topological invariants, pseudospin states, and the integer/valley/spin quantum Hall effects. Our focus is on engineered photonic topological insulators (PTIs) in two-dimensional systems. We highlight methods for characterizing such structures and how they result in unique wave-guiding properties. In addition, we provide recipes on how to realize PTIs using photonic crystals and metasurfaces, examine differences between different types of PTIs, and discuss limitations and advantages of some of the existing enabling platforms.},

abstract = {Quantum charge pumping phenomenon connects band topology through the dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system. In terms of a microscopic model, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger/Rice-Mele quantum pump continues to serve as a fruitful starting point for many considerations of topological physics. Here we present a generalized Creutz scheme as a distinct two-band quantum pump model. By noting that it undergoes two kinds of topological band transitions accompanying with a Zak-phase-difference of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ and \$2{\textbackslash}pi\$, respectively, various charge pumping schemes are studied by applying an elaborate Peierl's phase substitution. Translating into real space, the transportation of quantized charges is a result of cooperative quantum interference effect. In particular, an all-flux quantum pump emerges which operates with time-varying fluxes only and transports two charge units. This puts cold atoms with artificial gauge fields as an unique system where this kind of phenomena can be realized.},

This review presents a pedagogical account on topological insulator materials with an emphasis on basic theory and materials properties. After presenting a historical perspective and basic theories of topological insulators, it discusses all the topological insulator materials discovered as of May 2013, with some illustrative descriptions of the developments in materials discoveries in which the author was involved. A summary is given for possible ways to conﬁrm the topological nature in a candidate material. Various synthesis techniques as well as the defect chemistry that are important for realizing bulk-insulating samples are discussed. Characteristic properties of topological insulators are discussed with an emphasis on transport properties. In particular, the Dirac fermion physics and the resulting peculiar quantum oscillation patterns are discussed in detail. It is emphasized that proper analyses of quantum oscillations make it possible to unambiguously identify surface Dirac fermions through transport measurements. The prospects of topological insulator materials for elucidating novel quantum phenomena that await discovery conclude the review.},

abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator, but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. The 2D topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A 3D topological insulator supports novel spin polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium article we will review the theoretical foundation for these electronic states and describe recent experiments in which their signatures have been observed. We will describe transport experiments on HgCdTe quantum wells that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. We will then discuss experiments on Bi\_\{1-x\}Sb\_x, Bi\_2 Se\_3, Bi\_2 Te\_3 and Sb\_2 Te\_3 that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. We will then describe exotic states that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions, and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. We will close by discussing prospects for observing these exotic states, a well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

		This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to recent developments in geometrical and topological band theory following the discovery of graphene and topological insulators. Amusingly, many of these developments have a connection to contributions in high-energy physics by Dirac. The review starts by a presentation of the Dirac magnetic monopole, goes on with the Berry phase in a two-level system and the geometrical/topological band theory for Bloch electrons in crystals. Next, specific examples of tight-binding models giving rise to lattice versions of the Dirac equation in various space dimension are presented: in 1D (Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) and Rice–Mele models), 2D (graphene, boron nitride, Haldane model) and 3D (Weyl semi-metals). The focus is on topological insulators and topological semi-metals. The latter have a Fermi surface that is characterized as a topological defect. For topological insulators, the two alternative view points of twisted fiber bundles and of topological textures are developed. The minimal mathematical background in topology (essentially on homotopy groups and fiber bundles) is provided when needed. Topics rarely reviewed include: periodic versus canonical Bloch Hamiltonian (basis I/II issue), Zak versus Berry phase, the vanishing electric polarization of the SSH model and Dirac insulators.},

These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) eﬀect, in the absence of any external magnetic ﬁeld. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells. By varying the thickness of the quantum well, the band structure changes from a normal to an “inverted” type at a critical thickness dc. We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin quantum wells with well width dQW {\textless} 6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (dQW {\textgreater} 6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h. The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic ﬁeld. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, dc = 6.3 nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic ﬁeld induced insulator to metal transition.},

We find that in an experimentally accessible low temperature regime the symmetry allowed spin orbit potential converts graphene from an ideal two dimensional semimetallic state to a quantum spin Hall insulator. This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the quantized transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries. The edge states are non chiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder and symmetry breaking fields are discussed.},

Topological invariants are used to label distinct types of topological insulators. But it is not generally known how many or which invariants can exist in any given crystalline material. Using a new and efficient counting algorithm, we study the topological invariants that arise in time-reversal symmetric crystals. This results in a unified picture that explains the relations between all known topological invariants in these systems. It also predicts new topological phases and one entirely new topological invariant. We present explicitly the classification of all two-dimensional crystalline fermionic materials, and give a straightforward procedure for finding the analogous result in any three-dimensional structure. Our study represents a single, intuitive physical picture applicable to all topological invariants in real materials, with crystal symmetries.},
